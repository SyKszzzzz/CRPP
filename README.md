# Abstract
Collaborative perception is considered a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, in practical scenarios, the selection of data to transmit involves a trade-off between performance and communication costs, as well as the risk of privacy information leakage. To address these issues, we propose a model-agnostic collaboration algorithm called Collaborate Refinement with Probabilistic Propagation (CRPP). To avoid leakage of private information, CRPP only using object-level collaboration. It utilizes probabilistic propagation to combine the posterior probability with the class prior probability to refine the confidence. Further, it exploits distribution probability propagation to refine 3D BBox, which ultimately improves perception performance. We conduct experiments on the DAIR V2X dataset under both synchronous and asynchronous settings, and our method outperforms the basic baseline by 7.07%, 3.08%, and 2.77% in perception performance, respectively.
